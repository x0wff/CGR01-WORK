# Shop&Glow Mastermind Architecture

> **Chess Master Approach**: Fewer files, maximum strategic impact per line of code.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This e-commerce platform follows the **Psychological Thinking Mastermind** approach inspired by chess grandmasters - every move is strategic, every file serves multiple purposes, and psychological performance trumps technical metrics.

## 🎯 Core Strategy

### Architectural Principles
- **Write Once, Use Everywhere**: Universal utilities and components
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized configuration and state
- **Psychological Speed**: Users perceive performance through strategic design
- **Minimal Surface Area**: Reduced complexity, faster loading, easier maintenance

### File Structure (Mastermind Level)
```
├── index.html          # Single-page application with embedded templates
├── master.css          # Complete styling system with strategic utilities
├── core.js             # Universal utilities, state, and component system
├── config.json         # All configuration centralized
├── build.js            # Mastermind build system
├── optimize.js         # Psychological performance optimizer
└── .github/workflows/  # GitHub Actions for automated deployment
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development
```bash
# Serve locally with psychological speed optimizations
npm run dev
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
# Build optimized version
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

### Optimization
```bash
# Run performance psychology analysis
npm run optimize
```

## 🎨 Design Psychology

### Color Strategy
- **Primary Purple** (`hsl(262, 83%, 58%)`): Premium, luxury psychology
- **Secondary Emerald** (`hsl(160, 100%, 36%)`): Trust, growth, success
- **Gradient Combinations**: Creates depth and premium perception

### Performance Psychology
- **Critical CSS Inlined**: Above-the-fold content loads instantly
- **Skeleton Screens**: Users perceive faster loading
- **Progressive Animations**: Strategic micro-interactions for engagement
- **Strategic Spacing**: Breathing room creates premium feel

## 🏗️ Architecture Details

### State Management (Master.State)
```javascript
// Single source of truth for application state
Master.State.set('products', data);
Master.State.subscribe('products', callback);
```

### Component System (Master.Components)
```javascript
// Template-based component creation
const component = Master.Components.create(template, data);
Master.Components.render('#container', component);
```

### Universal Utilities (Master.Utils)
```javascript
// Reusable utilities across the application
Master.Utils.request('/api/products');
Master.Utils.debounce(callback, 300);
Master.Utils.lazy('.lazy-images', loadImage);
```
